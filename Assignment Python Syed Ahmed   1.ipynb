    "In DS710, Programming for Data Science, we're going to use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) for our [Python](https://www.python.org/) interface.  The other major alternative is [command line calls to the python interpreter](https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html) coupled with plain text files; [here](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter8/) is a brief introduction.  These notebooks are great for [short interactive code](https://svds.com/why-notebooks-are-super-charging-data-science/) like that for data science presentations, and story telling.  Command line Python and text files are good for [library code](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Modules_and_Packages) which will be used in many places.
