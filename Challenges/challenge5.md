## Welcome to Challenge 5

Welcome to the fifth challenge! 
Today's goal is to update your forked repository and then create a Pull Request


### Pre-requisite:
1. You should have completed [Challenge 4](https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-open-source-september-challenge) before starting this challenge. That means ensure your forked repository is in sync with the latest changes in the main challenge repository. Also, ensure that the new branch that you created in [Challenge 3](https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-open-source-september-challenge/blob/main/Challenges/challenge3.md) is also in sync with the latest changes in main challenge repository. 

### Resources:
1. Learn about creating a Pull Request [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
2. Learn about creating a Pull Request from a forked repository [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
3. Learn about creating a Pull Request from a branch [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request)
4. Learn about creating a Pull Request from a forked repository and branch [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork#creating-the-pull-request)



### Task

1. Sync your local forked repo - both the main branch and the branch you created with the latest changes from the remote main repository (https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-open-source-september-challenge) since the main repository has been updated since challenge 4. 

2. In your local forked repository, ensure you are currently in the branch that you created in  [Challenge 2](https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-open-source-september-challenge/blob/main/Challenges/challenge2.md). If not, switch to that branch.

3. Create a new directory inside the `contributors` folder (this should appear if you have correctly synced with the main repository), and give it the name of your github username. It should look something like this `contributors/<YOUR-GITHUB_USERNAME>/`. Ex.

```
contributors/shivaylamba/
```

4. Create a markdown file in the directory you created following the naming convention for the file: `<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>.md`. Ex.

```
contributors/shivaylamba/shivaylamba.md
```

5. Copy the following template into your file, delete the placeholder text and fill the information with yours.

```
---
name: your_name
github_user_name: YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME
---
```
6. Submit your Pull Request on the main challenge repository: i.e. https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-open-source-september-challenge .



### Note
You should also sync your fork on GitHub. After you have synced your local forked repository with the latest changes from the remote main repository, you should push these changes to your fork on GitHub to ensure that your online fork is also up to date. This step is important to make sure your online repository reflects the changes from the main repository before you create a Pull Request in the current challenge. So, both your local and online forks should be in sync with the main repository.
