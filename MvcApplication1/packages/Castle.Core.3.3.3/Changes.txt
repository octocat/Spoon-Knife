- Made the DependencyModel.IsOptional property writable

- Applied Curtis Schlak's patch fixing IOC-27
  "assembly resource format only works for resources where the assemblies name and default namespace are the same."
  
  Quoting:

  "I chose to preserve backwards compatibility by implementing the code in the 
  reverse order as suggested by the reporter. Given the following URI for a resource:

  assembly://my.cool.assembly/context/moo/file.xml

  It will initially look for an embedded resource with the manifest name of 
  "my.cool.assembly.context.moo.file.xml" in the loaded assembly my.cool.assembly.dll. 
  If it does not find it, then it looks for the embedded resource with the manifest name 
  of "context.moo.file.xml".

- IServiceEnabledComponent Introduced to be used across the project as
  a standard way to have access to common services, for example, logger factories

- Added missing log factories

- Refactor StreamLogger and DiagnosticLogger to be more consistent behavior-wise

- Refactored WebLogger to extend LevelFilteredLogger (removed duplication)

- Refactored LoggerLevel order

- Project started
