### Well hello there!;)
This repository is meant to provide an example for 🍴*forking*🍴 a repository on GitHub.

Creating a 🍴*fork*🍴 is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. 🍴Forks🍴 act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. 🍴Forking🍴 is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After 🍴forking🍴 this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit [a Pull Request](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife/pulls) as practice.

For some more information on how to 🍴fork🍴 a repository, [check out our guide, "Forking Projects""](http://guides.github.com/overviews/forking/). Thanks! :sparkling_heart:
