  SelenaK99 Thoughts This Evening: <br/><br/>
  Derive strength from your otherness.<br/><br/>
  Instead of trying to deny the parts of yourself that make you feel “othered”, 
  embrace them and find or create spaces that celebrate and positively utilize your otherness.<br/> 
  
  <br/>"As a leader, you don’t take all the risks; you teach your team how to take and manage risk. Mutualize risk and make people feel supported."<br/><br/>
  - Julie Harris<br/><br/>
  
  3 step process for taking clear-eyed risks:<br/><br/>

  1) Look at a raw idea.<br/>
  2) Strip away as much uncertainty as possible.<br/>
  3) Make a decision.<br/><br/>
  
  and “lean on your tribe” when taking clear-eyed risks.<br/>
